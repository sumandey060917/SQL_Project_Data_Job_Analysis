4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For this data job market analysis project, I used the following tools:

- **SQL**: Used to query and analyze the job market dataset.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system used to store and manage the data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used for writing and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used for version control and project collaboration.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    b.name As CompanyName,
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date,
    salary_year_avg
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS a
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim As b ON a.company_id=b.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short='Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location='Anywhere' AND
    b.company_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
